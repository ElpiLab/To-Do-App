# To-Do-App
A console for managing tasks for students

This is the Documentation of our To-Do App in the Programming Foundations class

## Analysis:

### Problem: As As students in 1st year of BIT, we face a challenge of managing tasks, learning, studying... 

### Solution:
a To-Do App, which can help students better manage their time, studying, learning,...  

### To-Do App: 
A user opens the app in the console → adds tasks → chooses one to work on → starts a Pomodoro (25 min work) → gets a 5 min break → marks the task as done. 

## Scenario: 

We have based on our modules, we have different requirements, teams, group projects. The idea is to put all tasks and deadline in  the tool to get notifications and reminders for task completion.

## User stories: 

- As a user, I want to
  - see the tasks in the console. 
  - share with others students from others modules for collaboration 
  - track time and see the time invested for each task or project 
  - categorize based on topics. 
  - sort and filter: priority, due date, category/subject, color-code, 
  - delete 
  - Mark tasks as done 
  - Get notify for due time 
  - Incorporate break for Pomodoro 
  - Calendar   
  - As a user, I want a file. 
  
## Use cases: 
  - Show Menu (from menu.txt) 
  - Create Tasks - Add new tasks with details
  - Show Current Tasks, To-Do, and Pomodoro, Due Time 
  - Tracking Tasks: Monitor completion stats
  - Pomodoro Session
