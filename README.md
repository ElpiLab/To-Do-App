# To-Do-App
A console for managing tasks for students
Here is the Documentation of our To-Do App in the Programming Foundations class

Analysis:

Problem: As students in 1st year of BIT, we face a challenge in our academic task management:

 - difficulty prioritizing assignments, studies, and deadlines
 - Poor times management leading to last-minute stress and assignment uploading
 - Lack of priority and productivity to maintain focus during studies
 - 
 of managing tasks, learning, studying... so a To-Do App might help students better manage their time.  

## The impact:
Without an effective system or strategy, students experience:
  - Missed deadlines or lower grades
  - increased stress
  - difficulty balancing individual and group work

## Solution To-Do App: 
The solution can be a Task Manager, as a console based application with task orgnaization

## Scenario: 
Based on our modules, we have different requirements, teams, group projects. The idea is to put all tasks and deadline in  the console application console to get notifications and reminders for task management and completion.

## User stories: 

- As a user, I want to see the overview of the tasks on the console
- As a user, I want to track time and see the time invested for each task or project 
- As a user, I want to categorize based on topics, priority, due date and color-code
- As a user, I want to delete tasks and mark tasks as done
- As a user, I want to track time using Pomodoro
- As a user, I want to see the weekly, monthy and yearly calender

### Use cases: 
  - Show Menu: Display list of actions: Add Task, View Tasks, Mark as Done, Delete, Exit
  - Create Tasks - Add new tasks with details: title, description, due date, priority
  - Show Current Tasks: Display curretn tasks, completed tasks, or Pomodoro Info 
  - Edit or delete Tasks in the console
  - Tracking Tasks: Show completion statistics and time spent
  - Pomodoro Session: Start, pause or reset a timer to manage work sessions
