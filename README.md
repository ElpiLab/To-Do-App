# To-Do App

A console-based application for managing tasks for students.  
This document presents the documentation of our To-Do App developed in the Programming Foundations class.

## Analysis

### Problem
As first-year BIT students, we face challenges juggling multiple modules, assignments, group projects, and personal study goals. This often leads to mental overload and decision fatigue, resulting in:

- Difficulty prioritizing tasks, leading to effort underestimation
- Poor time management, causing procrastination and last-minute stress
- Low productivity and reduced focus due to lack of structure

## Impact

The lack of a centralized task management system often leads to:

- Procrastination
- Inefficient study time
- Last-minute stress
- Missed deadlines for assignments and projects
- Lower academic performance

## Solution

Our interactive console-based To-Do App provides a simple and effective way to manage tasks by:

- Reducing stress through clear visualization of tasks
- Offering a centralized system based on task priorities

## Scenario

Students manage different modules, teams, and group projects at the same time.  
The idea is to store all tasks in one console application so users can organize and manage their workload in a clear and structured way.

## Requirements / User Stories

- As a user, I want to add a new task with a title, description, and priority so that all my tasks are centralized and organized.
- As a user, I want to view my tasks in the console so that I can easily see my current workload.
- As a user, I want to delete tasks that are no longer needed so that my task list stays clean and focused.

## Use Cases

- Show Menu: Display available actions in the console (Add Task, View Tasks, Delete Task, Exit).
- Create Tasks: Allow users to enter task details such as title, description, and priority level.
- Show Current Tasks: Display all tasks with clear information about priority and status.
- Delete Tasks: Allow users to permanently remove completed or unwanted tasks from the list.

## Technical Features

### 1. Interactive Console Application
The application interacts with the user through console input and provides clear prompts, menus, and feedback.

### 2. Data Validation
User input is validated to ensure data integrity. Invalid input is handled with clear error messages.

### 3. File Processing (Read/Write)
Tasks are saved to and loaded from a file, allowing data to persist between sessions.

## Future Roadmap (Missing Features)

- Pomodoro
- Task editing
- Time tracking
- Due dates & calendar
